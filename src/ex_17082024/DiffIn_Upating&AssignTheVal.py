age = 65 # point 1
print(age) # Output is 65

print(age+2) # Output is 67 ; point 2

age = age+1
print(age) # Output is 66, bcz in point 2 I haven't assigned age, it just I did one operation
# on age var. But I didn't assigned the updated value to age just like in point 1

# Another example

price = 10
print(price)  # Output is 10

price = price+1
print(price) # Output is 11

price+2
# I did I am performing plus operation but I didn't assigned its value to  a Var.
# If this statement was like - price = price+2 then it'll update the values as 13

print("Price is " , price)
